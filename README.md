# Base for Microservices built on NodeJS

This is just for use as a base project for creating NodeJS applications. I'll be forking off of this for some of my other projects.

## Installation:
* `npm install`
* Run `gulp`

## This base consists of:
* `Gulp` task runner for running tests and server
* `nodemon` to autoreload server during development (see `gulpfile.js`)
* Unit testing using `mocha` and `chai`
* Code Coverage using `istanbul`
* Config system for development and production
